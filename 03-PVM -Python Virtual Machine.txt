A Python program contains source code (first.py) that is first compiled by Python compiler to 
produce byte code (first.pyc). This byte code is given to Python Virtual Machine (PVM) which 
converts the byte code to machine code. This machine code is run by the processor and finally the 
results are produced. 


Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is a software that contains an interpreter that converts the byte 
code into machine code.

PVM is most often called Python interpreter. The PVM of PyPy contains a compiler in addition to 
the interpreter. This compiler is called Just In Time (JIT) compiler which is useful to speed up 
execution of the Python program.
