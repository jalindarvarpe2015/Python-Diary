#                           FUNDAMENTALS OF PYTHON
1- Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the year 1991.
2- Python is a high level programming language that contains features of functional programming 
   language like C and object oriented programming language like Java.

                              FEATURES OF PYTHON
□ Simple
    Python is a simple programming language because it uses English like sentences in its programs. 

□ Easy to learn
    Python uses very few keywords. Its programs use very simple structure. 

□ Open source
     Python can be freely downloaded from www.python.org website. Its source code can be read, 
     modified and can be used in programs as desired by the programmers. 

□ High level language
    High level languages use English words to develop programs. These are easy to learn and use. Like 
     COBOL, PHP or Java, Python also uses English words in its programs and hence it is called high 
     level programming language. 

□ Dynamically typed
    In Python, we need not declare the variables. Depending on the value stored in the variable, 
    Python interpreter internally assumes the datatype. 

□ Platform independent
     Hence, Python programs are not dependant on any computer with any operating system. We can 
     use Python on Unix, Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, etc. almost 
    all operating systems. This will make Python an ideal programming language for any network or 
    Internet.

□ Portable
    When a program yields same result on any computer in the world, then it is called a portable 
    program. Python programs will give same result since they are platform independent.
